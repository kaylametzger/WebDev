            Scott Sampson</h2>

            <p>
				What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to
            the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator
            at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has
            focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has 
            conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.</p>

           <p>	
			   Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology 
            from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of
            ceratopsids, or horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as 
            the growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.</p>

			<p>	Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of 
            Natural History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of 
            anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived
            at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the 
            Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the 
            Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the 
            phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>

			<p>	 In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted 
            paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the   
            United States and Canada. He was also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's
            Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in
            the Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and 
            their worlds to date.</p>
