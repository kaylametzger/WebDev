			<h3>The Aleutian World War II site houses the military ruins of Fort Schwatka,
			the highest coastal battery ever constructed in the U.S. The site is a 134-acre 
			tract of land located in Unalaska, Alaska on Amaknak Island. On June 3, 1942, 
			the day after the Battle of Midway, the Japanese attacked the Aleutian Islands. 
			For fifteen months, the Japanese occupied two of the islands.</h3>
			<h4> The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park is located in Skagway, 
			Alaska. In July, 1887, news reached the United States that gold had been discovered.
			At this time, the U.S. was in a financial recession, which encouraged men from 
			all walks of life to head for the Yukon. About 12.5 million ounces of gold have
			been taken from the Klondike area since its discovery.<br>
			<br> Sitka National Historical Park is Alaska's oldest federally designated
			park and was established as a federal park in 1890 to commemorate the 1804
			Battle of Sitka between the Tlingit Indians and the Russians. 
			Located within this 113-acre scenic park is the site of the Tlingit Fort 
			and battlefield. The Tlingit Indians developed practical ways of surviving
			on these islands centuries before the Russians appeared. They relied on the
			ocean and a variety of berries and game animals for their food.
