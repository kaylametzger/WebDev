		<h2>The National Preserves</h2>
		<b>Bering Land Bridge National Preserve:</b>
		<h3>Bering Land Bridge National Preserve is a remnant of what once was the
		Bering Land Bridge. Most archeologists believe that it was across the Bering
		Land Bridge that humans first traveled from Asia to populate the Americas.
		During the Last Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago, the water level of the oceans
		were lower, exposing land that today is under the Bering and Chukchi Seas. 
		This exposed area provided a migration route for people, animals, 
		and plant life.</h3>
		<b>Noatak National Preserve:</b>
		<h3>Noatak National Preserve is located in the northwestern part of Alaska 
		and was established to protect the Noatak River Basin. This basin is thought
		to be the last remaining complete river system in the United States that has
		not been altered by human activities. The basin was proclaimed a United States
		National Monument in 1978 and a National Preserve in 1980.</h3>
		<b>Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve:</b>
		<h3>Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve was proclaimed as a United States
		National Monument on December 1, 1978, and was redesignated a National Preserve
		on December 2, 1980. The Charley River has been named a National Wild River.</h3>
