			<b>When planning an Alaska trip, consider the following:</b>
			<h3>
				<i>
					Alaska contains eight national parks/preserves and four national preserves.
					Three of the more popular parks are Denali National Park and Preserve,
					Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, and Gates of the Arctic National 
					Park and Preserve.<br>
					<br>
					Caines Head State Recreation area is the site of an abandoned World War II fort.
					This territory was occupied by Japanese ground forces during World War II. <br>
					<br>
					Some other interesting sites include the Nancy Lake State Recreation Area, the 
					Totem Bight State Historical Park, which contains a native village model and a 
					number of reconstructed totem poles, and the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve.
